                <p  class = "poem" >In the heart of the Andes, beneath the equatorial gaze, lies Ecuadorâ€”a land where ancient mysteries intertwine with the celestial ballet. As night falls, the canvas of stars unfolds, revealing a cosmic poem written above the majestic peaks of Cotopaxi. The cosmic dance echoes from the Amazon to the Pacific shore, a symphony of elements and constellations. Amidst the vastness of space, Ecuador's beauty shines as a celestial law, inviting all to gaze upon the cosmic waltz and embrace the eternal romance between the Andean landscape and the stars.</p>
