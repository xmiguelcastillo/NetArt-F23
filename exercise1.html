  <p>Hit the house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (was persuasive, was persuasive)
From nine to five I know its vacant, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
Dreams of living life like rappers do (like rappers do, like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (they wasn't cool, they wasn't cool)
I fucked Sherane then went to tell my bros (tell my bros, tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on ("Let it Burn" came on, "Let it Burn" came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
Parked the car then we start rhyming, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (free our mind, free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (see dollar signs, see dollar signs)
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (we never knew, we never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue</p>
