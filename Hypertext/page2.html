<p>Jobs:

During high school, my first job was at Superfresh. I started as a stocker and later worked as a cashier. I remember walking with my friend and goofing around, as it was my first job. One summer, my uncle used to help people move their furniture and belongings to their other homes. I only lasted a month and a couple of weeks, but it showed me a different perspective on hard work. Carrying all that heavy stuff made me lose weight, and it was tiring but fun due to the heat and the cool, big houses I visited. Plus, they often gave generous tips. I also worked as a banquet server, where I served many people of different ages. In my senior year, I started working as a ride operator for Nickelodeon at the American Dream. That was my favorite job, as there were a lot of young people, the job was easy, the pay was decent, and riding the attractions afterward was fun. My side hustle involved going thrift shopping and reselling items. My favorite thrift store was a <a href="page3.html">GoodWill</a> in Harrison that, unfortunately, closed down.</p>
