<p>City/Town:

I was born on the 1st of September 2001. I spent most of my childhood in the City of Newark. I was raised on 6th Street and attended Abington Avenue School for elementary. One vivid memory I have is of my neighborhood opening the fire hydrant during the summer to create a makeshift water park. During my last year of elementary school, I transferred to <a href="page2.html">Belleville</a> School Number 4 and completed my schooling at Belleville High School.</p>
