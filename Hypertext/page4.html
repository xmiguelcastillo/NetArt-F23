Rutgers/CS:

When I came to this school, it was an experience unlike any I had ever encountered. The classes were extremely challenging, and finding a major was also <a href="page5.html">difficult</a> because I didn't know what to pursue. I eventually chose computer science (CS) and have been struggling with it, even to this day. However, it has taught me responsibility and the value of hard work using my brain. The people I've met and the things I've learned are experiences I wouldn't have had if I hadn't gone to college.
